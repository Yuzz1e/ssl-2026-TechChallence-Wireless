# Radio Communications Technical Challenge 2026 — Team Ri-one

**Submission category:** Wi-Fi Technical Challenge (IEEE 802.11ax, 6 GHz / Wi-Fi 6E band)
**Status:** Preliminary submission — 6 GHz bench latency/throughput collected; 5 GHz comparison data included; interference and on-field network-switching tests still pending (see Sections 4–6 and the open items below)

## 1. Goal and Motivation

Our approach focuses on lowering the barrier of entry for new teams by relying on highly accessible, Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. Instead of custom-designed PCBs or expensive specialized radio modules, we show that a standard **Intel AX210 (Wi-Fi 6E)** module combined with a modern SBC (**Radxa ROCK 5A**) provides a robust, high-bandwidth, interference-resistant communication link for the RoboCup SSL environment, at a fraction of the cost of bespoke hardware.

## 2. Hardware Architecture

Our robot communication stack is built on the following hardware:

| Component | Choice | Source |
|---|---|---|
| SBC | Radxa ROCK 5A (RK3588S) | [radxa.com/products/rock5](https://radxa.com/products/rock5/) |
| Radio Module | Intel AX210NGW (Wi-Fi 6E / 802.11ax) | [Intel product specifications](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/204836/intel-wifi-6e-ax210-gig/specifications.html) |
| Antenna | Standard M.2 notebook PCB antennas (~2.5 dBi gain) | generic COTS part, not a single fixed SKU — e.g. [MHF4 dual-band M.2 antenna kit](https://www.amazon.com/Antenna-Internal-2-4GHz-AX200-AX210/dp/B0C4QBF6HF) |
| Interface | M.2 E-Key | — |

### Why AX210 + ROCK 5A? (The Edge-AI Use Case)

Traditional 2.4 GHz/5 GHz Wi-Fi modules often suffer severe packet loss in crowded competition environments, which typically limits telemetry to simple coordinate data. We instead use the ROCK 5A's built-in NPU (Neural Processing Unit) for on-robot inference, which means we need to stream high-resolution debug images, rich telemetry, and neural-network outputs back to the base station in real time. The AX210's 6 GHz band gives this Edge-AI pipeline the throughput and clean RF environment it needs, at roughly $20 USD per module — a fraction of the cost of custom commercial radio modules.

### Open Hardware (eCAD)

The Wi-Fi radio path itself stays COTS-only by design (Section 1) — no custom PCB is needed for the AX210/ROCK 5A link. The team does design and publish custom PCBs for the rest of the robot, including the mainboard that bridges the ROCK 5A to the robot's motor control and sensors, in a separate repository: **[Rione/ssl-Circuit](https://github.com/Rione/ssl-Circuit)**, with the current ROCK 5A mainboard design at [`2026/PCB/MainBoard/MainBoard_V26_1_2`](https://github.com/Rione/ssl-Circuit/tree/baa913cb75b0630cb045215d907af2356b6a9d27/2026/PCB/MainBoard/MainBoard_V26_1_2).

## 3. Firmware and Environment

To make our results reproducible by any SSL team, we rely entirely on open-source Linux drivers and a containerized environment — no proprietary compilers required.

- Robot OS (ROCK 5A bench unit): Debian 13 (DietPi build)
- Analysis/measurement container OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, per the TC's reproducibility guidance — see [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile)
- Drivers: standard Linux `iwlwifi` (in-tree, no custom firmware)
- Wi-Fi bring-up config: [`wpa_supplicant.conf.example`](wpa_supplicant.conf.example) — pre-configures both the team's 6 GHz network and the shared network; see [MEASUREMENT.md](MEASUREMENT.md) Sections 10.8 and 11
- Automation: [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) + [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) install the measurement tools (`iperf3`, `tcpdump`, `iw`) and a Python/matplotlib environment that regenerates every chart in Section 6 from the raw data files already in this repo

### Setup Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yuzz1e/ssl-2026-TechChallence-Wireless.git
cd ssl-2026-TechChallence-Wireless

# Build the analysis/measurement container
docker-compose build

# Regenerate any chart from the raw data already in this repo, e.g.:
docker-compose run --rm measurement python3 plot_ping_test.py ping_test.txt ping_test

# Or drop into an interactive shell (iperf3 / tcpdump / iw / python3 all available):
docker-compose run --rm measurement bash
```

## 4. Summary Data Table

*Bench-test results below. Values reported as Mean / Std. dev. / Max (the official template's "Variance" column is reported here as standard deviation, in the same ms/Mbps units as the mean). Items marked **Pending** still need to be measured — see [Open Items](#8-open-items--still-needed-before-final-submission).*

| Metric | Intel AX210 (Wi-Fi 6E) — **6 GHz** result | 5 GHz comparison |
|---|---|---|
| Round-Trip Latency | Idle (60 FPS, n=7,625): Mean **1.45 ms**, σ 0.37 ms, Max 18.27 ms. Under 20 Mbps UDP: Mean **1.62 ms** (base→robot) / **1.65 ms** (robot→base), Max 2.53 ms (n=98 each) | Idle: 1.56 ms; loaded: 1.92 / 1.67 ms |
| Average Packet Loss | **0.00%** in every 6 GHz run (7,625/7,625 idle ICMP; 0/98 loaded ICMP; 0% UDP at 20 Mbps) | Same (0% at operational rates) |
| Data Rate (base station, received) | TCP: Mean **203.9 Mbps**, σ 21.9 Mbps, 262 retransmits/100 s (eth0 down, WiFi only). UDP 200 Mbps: **188.8 Mbps**, 0.02% loss. UDP 20 Mbps: **20.00 Mbps**, 0.00% loss | TCP: 207 Mbps; UDP 200M: 188 Mbps |
| Detect Interference | **Pending** — HackRF One and `iw survey dump` are part of the toolkit but no spectrum/channel-utilization capture has been logged yet |
| Start Up Time | **7.16 s** (`ifup@wlan0.service`, association + DHCP via `systemd-analyze blame`). From journal timestamps on the same boot: Wi-Fi associated ~4 s after `ifup` start, DHCP lease bound ~7 s after `ifup` start; `network-online.target` reached **9.35 s** after power-on (includes pre-network dependencies) |
| Power Consumption | **12 V** bench supply, robot-side (ROCK 5A + AX210). Idle (link up, no traffic): **0.17 A** (2.0 W). Loaded (TCP max-bandwidth test, ~208 Mbps): **0.26 A** (3.1 W). Single sample per condition — variance not yet characterized |
| Cost | ~$20 USD (AX210NGW module + M.2 antennas) — bill-of-materials estimate, not a bench measurement |
| Firmware Source | Standard Linux kernel `iwlwifi` driver (open source, no custom firmware) |
| eCAD | Wi-Fi radio path: N/A (COTS components, no custom PCB by design). Team mainboard (ROCK 5A ↔ rest of robot) eCAD published separately: [Rione/ssl-Circuit](https://github.com/Rione/ssl-Circuit), [`MainBoard_V26_1_2`](https://github.com/Rione/ssl-Circuit/tree/baa913cb75b0630cb045215d907af2356b6a9d27/2026/PCB/MainBoard/MainBoard_V26_1_2). STL antenna-mount files referenced in the draft are still not in this repo — need to be added |

## 5. Experimental Methodology

Detailed procedures (commands, `systemd-analyze` output, iperf flags, post-processing scripts, and limitations) are documented in **[MEASUREMENT.md](MEASUREMENT.md)**.

**Topology:** Radxa ROCK 5A + Intel AX210 as the robot-side client, a macOS base station (`172.15.0.44`, wired) as the server/receiver, on a private bench subnet. **6 GHz** traffic uses robot wlan0 `172.15.0.49` (`SSL_Rione_6G`, 5975 MHz). Earlier **5 GHz** runs used `172.15.0.22` (`SSL_Rione`, 5180 MHz). SSH/management: `172.15.0.47` (eth0).

- **Latency baseline:** ICMP `ping` at **60 FPS** (`-i 0.016` s), base station → robot, **7,625 probes** (~122 s at full rate).
- **Latency under load:** the same `ping` test (98 probes, both directions) run concurrently with a 20 Mbps UDP `iperf3` stream, to characterize latency under the kind of sustained telemetry load the Edge-AI use case requires.
- **Throughput / data rate:** `iperf3 3.18`, robot (client) → base station (server), 100 s per run:
  - TCP, unconstrained, to find maximum achievable bandwidth
  - UDP, 200 Mbps target, to find maximum achievable bandwidth without TCP's congestion control
  - UDP, 20 Mbps target, to model the actual NPU debug-data stream profile
- **Start-up time:** on the ROCK 5A, read `systemd-analyze blame` and `systemd-analyze critical-chain network-online.target` to isolate Wi-Fi bring-up; `ifup@wlan0.service` duration is reported as association + DHCP time. Cross-checked against `journalctl -b -u ifup@wlan0.service` for `wpa_supplicant` association and `dhclient` lease timestamps.
- **Power consumption:** measured at the robot's **12 V** input with a bench ammeter — one reading at idle (interface up, no `iperf`/ping traffic) and one during the TCP max-bandwidth run (~208 Mbps received at the base station).
- **Interference monitoring (not yet run):** planned approach is background logging of RSSI and channel busy time via `iw dev wlan0 survey dump`, plus a spectrum sweep using a HackRF One fitted with the UNIT-C6L's antenna to visualize channel congestion, correlated against packet loss.

## 6. Results and Analysis

### A. Latency and Packet Loss (6 GHz)

![6 GHz idle latency distribution](ping_test_6ghz.png)
*Figure 7: 6 GHz idle round-trip latency, 60 FPS cadence, 7,625 probes (macOS → ROCK 5A, wlan0 172.15.0.49).*

![6 GHz idle vs. loaded latency comparison](latency_udp_20mbps_comparison_6ghz.png)
*Figure 8: 6 GHz mean RTT — idle vs. under 20 Mbps UDP load, both directions.*

![6 GHz latency under 20 Mbps UDP, base→robot](ping_during_udp_20mbps_6ghz.png)
*Figure 9: 6 GHz RTT under 20 Mbps UDP load, base station → robot.*

![6 GHz latency under 20 Mbps UDP, robot→base](ping_during_udp_20mbps_from_rock5a_6ghz.png)
*Figure 10: 6 GHz RTT under 20 Mbps UDP load, robot → base station.*

**Analysis (6 GHz):** At 60 FPS probe rate (modelling telemetry cadence), idle RTT was **1.45 ms** (σ 0.37 ms) with zero loss over 7,625 probes. Under a 20 Mbps UDP stream, mean RTT rose only to **1.62–1.65 ms** depending on direction — comparable to or better than the earlier 5 GHz runs, with no packet loss.

### B. Throughput / Data Rate (6 GHz)

![6 GHz TCP max-bandwidth test](iperf_tcp_max_bandwidth_test_6ghz.png)
*Figure 11: 6 GHz TCP maximum-bandwidth test, robot → base station, 100 s.*

![6 GHz UDP 20 Mbps stream test](iperf_udp_20mbps_test_6ghz.png)
*Figure 12: 6 GHz UDP at 20 Mbps target — NPU debug-stream profile.*

![6 GHz UDP 200 Mbps target test](iperf_udp_test_6ghz.png)
*Figure 13: 6 GHz UDP at 200 Mbps target.*

**Analysis (6 GHz):** TCP throughput reached **~204 Mbps** (receiver, **wlan0 only** — eth0 disabled to avoid same-subnet wired leakage). This is in line with the 5 GHz reference (~207 Mbps). UDP at 200 Mbps target achieved **189 Mbps** with negligible loss; at 20 Mbps the link sustained **0.00% loss**. Raw Mbps is similar across bands in this bench; the decisive 6 GHz advantage is not peak throughput but **spectrum availability and cleanliness** — see Band Selection below.

### C. Why 6 GHz (Wi-Fi 6E) over 5 GHz — Band-Selection Discussion

![5 GHz vs 6 GHz throughput and latency](band_comparison_throughput.png)
*Figure 14: 5 GHz vs 6 GHz — TCP/UDP throughput (left) and round-trip latency (right). On a quiet bench the two bands are nearly identical.*

![JP regulatory channel map, 5 GHz vs 6 GHz](band_comparison_spectrum.png)
*Figure 15: JP regulatory channel map from the AX210 — 6 GHz offers 22 DFS-free channels vs only 8 non-DFS channels on 5 GHz (16 of the 24 are radar/DFS-encumbered).*

The throughput and latency numbers are similar between bands *on a quiet bench* (Figure 14), but a robot soccer venue is the opposite of quiet, and this is where the 6 GHz band of Wi-Fi 6E becomes decisive (Figure 15). Reading the AX210's actual regulatory channel map on the ROCK 5A (`iw phy phy0 channels`, country `JP`) makes the argument concrete:

| Property (JP regulatory domain) | 5 GHz | 6 GHz (Wi-Fi 6E) |
|---|---|---|
| Channels flagged for **radar detection (DFS)** | **16** channel entries (ch 52–64, 100–144) | **0** |
| Non-DFS 20 MHz channels actually usable | only **8** (UNII-1 ch 36–48 + UNII-3 ch 149–165) | **22** (and counting, as JP opens more) |
| Channel-availability check (CAC) before use | up to **60 s** on DFS channels | none |
| Radar event during a match | forces an **immediate channel switch / link drop** | cannot happen |
| Incumbent / consumer congestion | very high (every home AP, every phone) | minimal (6 GHz still sparsely deployed) |

**The DFS problem in 5 GHz.** More than half of the 5 GHz channels available to us in Japan (ch 52–64 and 100–144) are **DFS channels**: the radio must perform a Channel Availability Check (silent listening, up to ~60 s, longer on weather-radar sub-bands) *before* it may transmit, and if it ever detects a radar pulse it must **vacate the channel immediately**. For a robot during a match, a DFS-triggered channel switch means a multi-second blackout of the telemetry and control link — operationally unacceptable. In practice that leaves only the 8 non-DFS 5 GHz channels (UNII-1 / UNII-3), which are exactly the channels every consumer access point and phone hot-spot in the building is already fighting over.

**Why 6 GHz removes the constraint.** On the same module, the 6 GHz band exposes **zero radar/DFS channels** and **22 immediately-usable 20 MHz channels** in the current JP allocation — with **no CAC delay and no radar-eviction risk**. Because Wi-Fi 6E is still sparsely deployed, those channels are also far cleaner, so we can confidently run **wide (80/160 MHz) channels** for the high-resolution NPU debug stream without the channel-planning headaches of 5 GHz. In short: 5 GHz gives us *similar peak speed but a tiny, congested, DFS-encumbered pool of channels*, whereas 6 GHz gives us *the same speed plus a large pool of clean, DFS-free channels* — a far better fit for a contested, latency-sensitive RoboCup SSL environment.

*Figure 17: 5 GHz TCP maximum-bandwidth test — reference run.*

### F. Start-Up Time and Power Consumption

**Start-up time:** `systemd-analyze blame` on the ROCK 5A attributes **7.16 s** to `ifup@wlan0.service`, which wraps Wi-Fi association (`wpa_supplicant`) and DHCP (`dhclient`). On the boot under test, `wpa_supplicant` logged `CTRL-EVENT-CONNECTED` ~4 s after `ifup` began, and `dhclient` bound address `172.15.0.22` ~7 s after `ifup` began — consistent with the systemd figure. End-to-end time until `network-online.target` was **9.35 s** from power-on, including DietPi pre-boot services that run before `ifup@wlan0` starts.

**Power consumption:** At the robot's 12 V input, current draw was **0.17 A (2.0 W)** idle and **0.26 A (3.1 W)** during the TCP max-bandwidth test — an increase of **0.09 A (~1.1 W)** under full link load. Measurements are single-point bench readings; repeated samples under idle/loaded conditions would be needed to report variance.

### G. Interference Detection and Channel Utilization

**`iw survey dump` is not supported on the AX210.** The command returns no data: Intel's `iwlwifi` driver does not implement the nl80211 survey / channel-busy-time interface (`NL80211_CMD_GET_SURVEY`), so channel-utilization percentage cannot be read from this NIC (verified connected and post-scan; raw capture in `iw_survey_station_6ghz.txt`). As a substitute we log per-station RF metrics from `iw dev wlan0 station dump` on the 6 GHz link: **signal -48 dBm** (avg -53 dBm), **beacon loss 0**, **TX retries/failed 0/0**, RX 286.7 Mbit/s (HE-MCS 11, 2 SS) — consistent with a clean, uncongested 6 GHz channel. True channel-busy-time will instead come from a HackRF One spectrum sweep.

**HackRF spectrum sweep (5 GHz band).** Because `survey dump` is unavailable, we captured the spectrum with a HackRF One (`hackrf_sweep`, 1 MHz bins, 2 passes) over the full 5 GHz band (5150–5910 MHz), once **idle** (`out_base.csv`) and once with the **5 GHz shared network under load** (`out.csv`). The overlay below confirms the shared network's operating channel: a sharp, persistent carrier at **5180 MHz (ch36, `SSL_Rione`)** stands ~8–10 dB above the noise floor in both captures, and under load the smoothed power across the band rises by roughly **+0.3 dB on the operating channel and up to +11 dB on busy adjacent/DFS channels** — i.e. the 5 GHz band is occupied and contended. This is exactly the congestion that the 6 GHz team link (5975 MHz) avoids. (The HackRF tops out at 6000 MHz, so the 6 GHz channel itself sits at the very edge of its range; a 6 GHz-capable front-end is still needed for an equivalent 6 GHz capture.)

![5 GHz spectrum: idle vs. under load](spectrum_sweep_5ghz.png)
*Figure 18: 5 GHz HackRF sweep — idle baseline (grey) vs. shared network under load (red). Top: power spectrum (faint = raw 1 MHz bins, bold = 9-MHz rolling average); the dashed line marks `SSL_Rione` ch36 (5180 MHz) and the shaded region the JP DFS channels. Bottom: smoothed load − baseline delta (red = added energy under load).*

> **Antenna caveat (found during hardware sourcing, not yet resolved):** the UNIT-C6L's two RP-SMA ports are tuned for 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and 868–923 MHz LoRa respectively — neither is matched to the 5/6 GHz band this capture targets. The HackRF One itself tunes 1 MHz–6 GHz regardless of antenna, but reusing the UNIT-C6L's *included* antennas here will under-read 5/6 GHz signal levels. Substitute a broadband (e.g. ANT500) or dedicated 5/6 GHz antenna before running this test. Details in [MEASUREMENT.md](MEASUREMENT.md) Section 7.

### H. Network-Switching Time (shared <-> team network)

The official rules require demonstrating a quick switch between the TC-provided shared Wi-Fi network and the team's own network. We modelled this with two real SSIDs on the bench — the **team network** `SSL_Rione_6G` (6 GHz, WPA3-SAE) and a **shared network** `SSL_Rione` (5 GHz, WPA3-SAE) — both pre-configured in `wpa_supplicant`, switched with `wpa_cli select_network`. Control/SSH ran over **wired eth0** so the Wi-Fi link could be torn down and rebuilt without losing the management channel.

![Network switching time](network_switch_test.png)
*Figure 21: Association switch time between the 6 GHz team network and the 5 GHz shared network (5 trials each direction).*

| Switch target | Mean | Min / Max | First data (ping) |
|---|---|---|---|
| → 6 GHz team (`SSL_Rione_6G`) | **481 ms** | 352 / 636 ms | assoc + ~10–20 ms |
| → 5 GHz shared (`SSL_Rione`) | **326 ms** | 236 / 457 ms | assoc + ~10–20 ms |

**Analysis:** Both directions complete the full re-association (scan + SAE authentication + key handshake) in **well under one second**, and because both networks share the same `/22` subnet the DHCP lease is retained, so the first packet flows ~10–20 ms after association — effectively a sub-second, near-seamless handover for a robot mid-match. The slightly higher cost of switching *to* 6 GHz comes from a required 6 GHz scan that re-acquires the Wi-Fi 6E self-managed regulatory domain (the AX210 disables 6 GHz channels while associated to 5 GHz, then re-enables them on hearing a 6 GHz beacon); switching *to* 5 GHz needs no such step. Raw data, the benchmark script, and the procedure are in [MEASUREMENT.md](MEASUREMENT.md) Section 11.

## 7. Conclusion

Our approach shows that COTS Wi-Fi 6E modules like the Intel AX210 can provide a highly accessible, low-cost, and robust communication link for SSL robots. Paired with the ROCK 5A, it clears the bandwidth bottleneck for Edge-AI applications while avoiding the congested 2.4/5 GHz spectrum entirely. We encourage other teams to consider this architecture as a way to reduce hardware-development overhead — directly in line with the Technical Challenge's goal of lowering the barrier to entry for new and existing teams.

## 8. Open Items — Still Needed Before Final Submission

- **Confirm band/channel:** ~~needed~~ — **done** for 6 GHz (`5975 MHz`, `SSL_Rione_6G`; see [MEASUREMENT.md](MEASUREMENT.md) Section 10).
- **Identify the access point/router** used to bridge the ROCK 5A and the base station for these bench tests, for the methodology writeup.
- **Detect Interference:** `iw dev wlan0 survey dump` is **unsupported on the AX210** (iwlwifi exposes no channel-busy-time); per-station RF metrics are logged instead (signal -48 dBm, 0 beacon loss, 0 TX retries on 6 GHz). A HackRF One **5 GHz sweep is now captured** (idle vs. loaded, `out_base.csv`/`out.csv`, Figure 18). **Still to do:** an equivalent capture on the 6 GHz operating channel (needs a 6 GHz front-end, since the HackRF tops out at 6000 MHz and the UNIT-C6L antennas are tuned for 2.4 GHz / sub-1 GHz — see caveat in Section 6.G).
- **Power consumption (variance):** repeat idle/loaded current readings to report σ; current table entries are single bench samples.
- ~~**Network-switching demonstration:**~~ — **measured** (see Section 6.H). Mean switch time **481 ms** to the 6 GHz team network and **326 ms** to the 5 GHz shared network; first data (ping) follows ~10–20 ms later. Still to do on-field: integrate the switch into a live friendly-match demo.
- **eCAD/STL files:** the draft references STL files for antenna mounts; these still aren't in this repo and are required for the open-source release. The radio path itself has no eCAD (COTS-only by design); the team's mainboard PCB design (Section 2) is published separately at [Rione/ssl-Circuit](https://github.com/Rione/ssl-Circuit).
- ~~**Reproducible environment:**~~ — **done.** [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) + [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) now actually exist and install `iperf3`/`tcpdump`/`iw`/Python+matplotlib; [`wpa_supplicant.conf.example`](wpa_supplicant.conf.example) extracted as a real file; README Section 3's OS line corrected to the actual Debian 13 (DietPi) bench image.
- ~~**Repository URL:**~~ — **done.** Setup instructions now point at the real repo, [github.com/Yuzz1e/ssl-2026-TechChallence-Wireless](https://github.com/Yuzz1e/ssl-2026-TechChallence-Wireless). **Still manual:** the local changes from this pass (this README, MEASUREMENT.md, and the new Dockerfile/docker-compose.yml/requirements.txt/wpa_supplicant.conf.example) are not committed/pushed yet — `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` need to happen before the mailing-list link will show this content.
